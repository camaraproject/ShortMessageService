  title: SMS Delivery Notification Subscription
  description: |
    API to create, retrieve and delete event subscriptions related to a sms delivery operation performed on an associated phone number.

    # Introduction

    With this API, customers can create subscriptions for receiving delivery notification on the requests sent.
    
    The consumer id in the request gives the identity of the consumer for which call back notification subscription to be enabled.
    
    Upon successfully creating a subscription, the API will provide an Event Subscription ID, and it will indicate the subscription's expiration date.
    
    After delivering the SMS, the event subscriber will be notified back to the provided Notification-Url given by the subscription-request.
    
    SMS delivery notification API could be useful in scenarios such as:
    
    - Reconciliation (by the API consumer) on the number of messages sent vs delivered.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    # API Functionality    

    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows CloudEvents specification.

    It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event `type` for which the client would like to subscribe.  
    
    Following event ``type`` are managed for this API:
      - ``org.camaraproject.sms.v0.-status``  - Event triggered when the sms delivery task is completed by the server
        
    Note: Additionally to these list, ``org.camaraproject.sms.v0.subscription-ends`` notification `type` is sent when the subscription ends. 
    This notification does not require dedicated subscription. 

    It is used when:
      - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached 
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely



    The API exposes following capabilities:
      * **/subscriptions**: This endpoint has two operations, one that allows to retrieve the list of SMS delivery event subscriptions and another one to create new event subscriptions.
      * **/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}**: This endpoint also has two operations, one that allows to retrieve a particular event subscription by id and another one to delete an event subscription also using the id.

    ## SMS delivery notification subscription

    Theses endpoints allow to manage notification subscription on Send SMS delivery event. 
    The CAMARA subscription model is detailed in the CAMARA API design guideline document and follows Cloudevents specification.

    It is mandatory in the subscription to provide the event `type` subscribed are several are managed in this API.

    Only one event ``type`` is managed for this API: 
      - ``org.camaraproject.sms.v0.sms-delivery-status`` - Event triggered when a sms delivery event occurs on the any request given by the consumer


  
    ### Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred. As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the listener side as `POST /{$request.body#/webhook/notificationUrl}`
      will be posted by the sim swap resource server to the webhook url provided by notification 
      listener.

    # Authorization and authentication

    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md). Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

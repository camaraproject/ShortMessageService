  title: SMS API
  description: |
    The API provides the customer with the ability to send SMS to the destination address(es).
    Customer can use this API to send SMS in following scenarios:
    1. Application to Application (A2A) which might be a binary message and 
    2. Application to Person (A2P) which would be a text message. 
   
    For A2P, there are 3 different categories of SMS i.e. Service, Promotional & Transactional. 
    
    This API is used to messages across the above mentioned scenarios and categories.
    
    Pre-requisite for using this API is that SMS Sender application / enterprise (or customer) needs to onboard themselves with the access provider before using this API. 
    This API has only single operation to send SMS. ShortMessage Provides the capability to deliver SMS to the recepient. 
    In order to the receive delivery receipt separate API to be defined which is to be implemented by the API consumer for sending back the delivery receipt to the 'Send SMS' API consumer in a standardized callback API.
